Ingredients:

1lb ground beef
1 tsp rosemary
1 tsp thyme 
Half a vidalia onion, diced
Salt and pepper to taste 
1 egg (per burger)
2 tsp olive oil
Your favorite cheese
Brioche bun

Steps:
In a bowl, combine the beef, rosemary, thyme, diced onion, salt, and peper. 
Divide beef into four chunks. (or less, depending on how hungry you are). Shape into relatively thing patties that are 
slightly larger than your bun- they will shrink during cooking. 

In a pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Once pan gets somewhat hot, place the patty in, laying away from you to avoid 
splatters. Cook roughly 6-7 minutes per side, or until medium - medium well in the center, or until done to your liking. 

When the patty is almost done, put a knob of butter into the pan. Crack an egg into the pan and fry. 
Also at this time, add your cheese to the patty. Baste with oil/butter mixture to melt. 

Once the cheese is melted, your cheeseburger is ready. Enjoy!
